│ I need to create a dashboard that has following trace_id | x-atlan-agent-id | timestamp | duration | payload_asset_size                                                    │
 │ | payload_request_bytes | asset_guid | vertex_id | diffCalcTime | lineageCalcTime | validation Time | ingestion Time | Notification Time | Audit Log Time etc

 Observe method createcurspOrUpdate in attached file. AtlasEntitiesWithExtInfo is the POJO that materialises user payload. the relations that can be created to/from the         │
 @
 │ asset using relationshipAttributes, appendRelationshipAttributes, removeRelationshipAttributes; There can be some tags attached to an asset via classifications; There     │
 │ can be some business attributes or customAttributes attached to an asset via businessAttributes/customAttributes. There can be terms attached to an asset via              │
 │ meanings. Some observability already exists check AtlasPerfMetrics.MetricRecorder @common/src/main/java/org/apache/atlas/utils/AtlasPerfMetrics.java ,                     │
 │ @webapp/src/main/java/org/apache/atlas/web/filters/AuditFilter.java [check audit(AuditLog auditLog) method or something like @TaskMetricsService

 This should help you to get payload_asset_size : count of entities , and paylaod_size_in_bytes

 also as it is a bulk request I need to get all the top level vertex guids [guids of all the objects in entities array if they exist] if guid is not provided or empty      │
  │ that means asset has to be created. Check method createOrUpdate and preCreateOrUpdate to get asset_guids and corresponding vertex_id

 For diffCalcTime : this is operation to get diff of what already exists in the system and what user is requesting now to attach. Need to get the time taken for this       │
 │ operation. See class @repository/src/main/java/org/apache/atlas/repository/store/graph/v2/AtlasEntityComparator.java method : getDiffResult

│ for linCalcTime, check which lineage method is called and their computation time : check method addHasLineage, removeHasLineageOnDelete,                                   │
 │ resetHasLineageOnInputOutputDelete.
